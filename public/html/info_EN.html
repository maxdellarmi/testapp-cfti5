            <p>The <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia</em> (<em>Catalogue of Strong Italian Earthquakes</em>) is the most important outcome of a well-established collaboration between the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica (ING; since 2000 Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, INGV), the leading Italian institution for basic and applied research in seismology and solid earth geophysics, and SGA (Storia Geofisica Ambiente), a private firm specializing in the historical investigation and systematization of adverse natural phenomena. The collaboration with SGA came to an end in 2007, when part of its personnel became INGV permanent staff.</p>

            <p>The <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia, 461 a.</em>C. - <em>1980 </em>was first published in Italian in 1995 by Boschi <em>et al. </em>(1995: CFTI 1). It was intended as a complete account of Italian "strong earthquakes", of their territorial impact and of the social and economic upheaval caused. The decision of focusing only on the largest earthquakes was dictated by the need to establish a priority among the vast number of events reported in traditional catalogues. Only earthquakes with a reported maximum intensity equal to or bigger than intensity VIII-IX on the MCS scale were considered in&nbsp; the first release of the catalogue, but this threshold was progressively relaxed for its subsequent versions. The second &nbsp;release, that appeared two years later, included more earthquakes, was based on more accurate research, and covered a longer time span (461 B.C. to 1990) (Boschi <em>et al., </em>1997: CFTI 2).</p>

            <p>Knowing that the record of Italian historical seismicity is probably the most extensive of the whole world, and hence that the catalogue could be of interest for a wider international readership, Boschi <em>et al</em>. (2000) decided to share this experience with colleagues from foreign countries by preparing an English version of the catalogue. The new release (CFTI 3) entailed much additional research and fine tuning of methodologies and algorithms, including earthquakes up to 1997.</p>

            <p>Following the publication of two large research bodies on the seismicity of the Mediterranean region up to the 10th century (Guidoboni <em>et al.</em>, 1994) and between the 11th and 15th century (Guidoboni and Comastri, 2005), the area of relevance of the catalogue was extended to the entire Mediterranean basin. The new contents, which included only basic seismological parameters (felt reports and epicentral location for Italian earthquakes, epicentral location only for the other Mediterranean earthquakes), appeared in a new version of the catalogue (CFTI4Med), published in 2007 as a web and web-GIS repository (Guidoboni et al., 2007).</p>

            <p>A decade later we are proud to present a new, largely revised and updated version of the catalogue, termed CFTI5Med. This new version features:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the retrieval and formatting of over 23,000 <a href="help_IT.html#biblio" target="_blank">original bibliographic documents</a>, transcribed or printed, nearly 50% of those utilized in the CFTI5Med. These documents are now available on-line as fully searchable pdf files;</li>
			<li>a full geological reinterpretation, georeferencing and reprocessing of over 2,300 descriptions of earthquake-induced environmental effects, which are now all available and searchable in a user-friendly web-GIS environment;</li>
			<li>the elaboration of a number of texts and commentaries that were missing from the CFTI4Med version of the catalogue;</li>
			<li>a totally re-designed and more efficient web- and web-GIS interface.</li>
			</ul>

            <p>The new <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia</em> includes 1,259 earthquakes that occurred in Italy (98 of which are currently considered false). No commentaries on the main earthquake effects were available in the previous version of the catalogue for&nbsp; 87 of such events as they had not been updated with respect to the information supplied in Guidoboni e Comastri (2005) for the 1000 AD-1500 AD time interval. The commentaries concerning the most significant effects of Italian medieval earthquakes have now been elaborated and are available along with the information on more recent events. For the remainder of the earthquakes first presented with the CFTI4Med - those that occurred in the general Mediterranean area away from the Italian coasts - the new catalogue provides only the felt reports and basic epicentral parameters.</p>

            <p>While the Italian earthquake record is an outstanding source of information, it nonetheless carries the inherent danger - and perhaps the parodox - of generating a distorted picture of the seismogenic potential of any area. The result in most instances is an underestimation of the earthquake potential, but also often an overestimation; in both cases the misrepresentation of the earthquake potential may result in dire consequences, especially in areas of potential economic development. Until recently, the results of historical research have been summed up in traditional <em>parametric catalogues</em>, a form of presentation that indeed provides the basic information required by the elaboration of conventional seismic hazard models, but also inevitably impoverishes the available information, potentially introducing biases and misrepresentations of the earthquake activity. Basic principles or earthquake source physics show that two crustal earthquakes of a magnitude 6.0 and 7.0 may cause the same peak acceleration and the same maximum macroseismic effects, but the area of strongest ground shaking will be much smaller for the 6.0 magnitude quake with respect to the 7.0 event. In the absence of instrumental data, the relative importance of the two earthquakes can be understood only by compiling a complete picture of their dynamic effects, something that traditional earthquake catalogues, focusing only on epicentral intensity, failed to supply.</p>

            <p>The <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia </em>reversed this trend, allowing for a more complete appreciation of the total energy released by any given earthquake and of the finest characteristics of its territorial impact. It is hence an <em>analytical catalogue</em>, supplying <u>all</u> the information available for any given earthquake in a pre-defined and easily accessible format, and including data and observations that may not be immediately relevant to seismic hazard applications but may be of interest for broader seismic risk analyses and for a number of other applications.</p>

            <p>The basic principles of the <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia</em> were discussed at length in a special issue of <em>Annali di Geofisica</em> (later renamed <em>Annals of Geophysics</em>) that accompanied version 3 of the catalogue (<a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/issue/view/268"><em>Boschi <em>et al.</em>, 2000</em></a>). In the following we briefly describe the main features of the catalogue, referring the reader to specific articles from the special issue for further information on any given topic. Notice that the articles are available only in English.</p>

            <p>The motivations of the <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia</em> are discussed in detail in the contribution entitled <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3660"><em>"A 'new generation' earthquake catalogue"</em></a>, by Enzo Boschi. After drawing a history of earthquake catalogues throughout the 20th century, the paper discusses the reasons why Italy has long been known as "the cradle of historical seismology". The density of the population and the wealth of historical heritage on the one hand, and the frequency of destructive earthquakes and the youthful geology of Italy on the other hand formed the basis for developing the most accurate record of historical seismicity currently available worldwide.</p>

            <p>The general framework of modern historical seismology and its complex relations with instrumental seismology and seismotectonics on the one hand and with historical research on the other hand are outlined in the contribution <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3661"><em>"Method of investigation, typology and taxonomy of the basic data: navigating between seismic effects and historical contexts"</em></a>, by Emanuela Guidoboni<em>. </em>But research on past earthquakes also requires developing a standardization that takes into account the semantic value and the hierarchy of the retrieved historical sources on the one hand, and their relations with the economic context and the building style on the other hand. In the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3663"><em>"Seismic scenarios and assessment of intensity: some criteria for the use of the MCS scale"</em></a> Graziano Ferrari and Emanuela Guidoboni elucidate all the difficulties involved in the use of any earthquake intensity scale.</p>

            <p>In principle, the diversity of Italian landscape led to an ubiquitous presence of scholars and cultural centers meant that Earth tremors were witnessed and minutely recorded down the ages for subsequent generations living in any given area of Italy. In many instances, however, information flowed towards the main cultural centres, with certain areas probably being cut off from the rest of the landmass not only by mountain chains but also on account of wars, religious differences and other historical phenomena. The extent to which this isolation may have altered the "collective memory" of Italian earthquakes - and hence the perception of the associated hazard - is discussed by Gianluca Valensise and Emanuela Guidoboni in the article <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3672"><em>"Towards new research strategies: silent seismogenic areas or silent sources?"</em></a><em>. </em></p>

            <p>When research on historical earthquakes is conducted also on a territorial basis one may encounter evidence for "unknown earthquakes", that is, real earthquakes that are not known to any current compilation. The paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3667"><em>"Unknown earthquakes: a growing contribution to the Catalogue of Strong Italian Earthquakes"</em></a> by Dante Mariotti, Alberto Comastri and Emanuela Guidoboni elucidates the main challenges involved in unearthing the evidence for earthquakes overshadowed by other larger events, or affected by chronological mistakes, loss of information or concomitance with other considerable natural phenomena.</p>

            <p>One of the most significant features of historical seismology data down through history is their extremely high spatial resolving power. Mario Baratta, the compiler of the first modern earthquake catalogue of Italian history (Baratta, 1901), stated that "<em>research into past tremors, together with the monographic study of each single quake occurring in a given region up to modern times, allow us to identify various quake 'focuses' or 'radiants'</em>". Baratta identified over 250 'seismic centres' in Italy, one every 1200 km<sup>2</sup>, or in other words, one every 35 km along any cross-sectional line drawn across the peninsula. Indeed the accuracy with which the epicentres of quakes were determined by historical and more recent data was unrivalled until the first half of the seventies.</p>

            <p>But turning historical data into quantitative seismological parameters involved the need to develop objective analytical techniques to assess earthquake intensities and subsequently obtain the main properties of the earthquakes source. The paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3669"><em>"Reducing the subjectivity of intensity estimates: the Fuzzy Sets approach"</em></a> by Gianfranco Vannucci, Paolo Gasperini and Graziano Ferrari outlines a method for the encoding and the computer analysis of the macroseismic effects derived from historical sources, allowing the process of seismic intensity assessment to be completely formalized using a multi-criteria decisions-support algorithm. In the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3670"><em>"Deriving numerical estimates from descriptive information: the computation of earthquake parameters"</em></a> Paolo Gasperini and Graziano Ferrari describe the long and meticulous development of what is now a widely accepted and consolidated approach for turning intensity data into robust numerical estimates: the <em>Boxer</em> computer code. Finally, in the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3671"><em>"From earthquake intensifies to earthquake sources: extending the contribution of historical seismology to seismotectonic studies"</em></a> Paolo Gasperini and Gianluca Valensise discuss how to turn the intensity data available for pre-instrumental into "equivalent earthquakes sources", a crucial step for building seismogenic models and obtaining more detailed and more reliable seismic hazard estimates.</p>

            <p>A fundamental - yet often unappreciated - benefit from historical earthquake documentation is a greater understanding of the heterogeneous nature of widespread, small-scale property damage caused by local amplifications of ground motion. While the theory underlying these phenomena is well understood today, only the historical record can verify the existence of these repeated localized damage patterns. In recent years the seismic response of several important urban centres like Bologna, Catania, Palermo, Ferrara and Florence has been investigated by specific research programmes. Emanuela Guidoboni and Graziano Ferrari summarize the results of this research effort in their contribution <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3662"><em>"The effects of earthquakes in historical cities: the peculiarity of the Italian case"</em></a><em>. </em>But local site amplifications are not the only condition that may control the seismic response of the built enviroment. Other relevant variable were discussed in the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3663"><em>"Historical variables of seismic effects: economic levels, demographic scales and building techniques"</em></a>, also by Emanuela Guidoboni and Graziano Ferrari. In most cases, these studies entail detailed investigations of the huge body of information contained in the <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia. </em>The results of these studies are now becoming an integral part of the background knowledge available to town planners, architects and restorers, and therefore an indispensable means of reducing the vulnerability of Italy's historic architectural heritage.</p>

            <p>Finally, the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3665"><em>"Earthquake effects on the environment: from historical descriptions to thematic cartography"</em></a><em>, </em>by Gianluca Valensise and Emanuela Guidoboni attempts to bridge the gap between earthquake history and geology. The effects of earthquakes on the environment may be subdivided into two categories: those effects related to shaking, and those which may be due directly to the seismogenic source. While the former include significant changes in the landscape and in the local hydrology - just think of the large earthquake-induced landlsides caused by Italian earthquakes, the latter generally have a lesser territorial impact yet they may entail a considerable scientific interest.</p>

            <p>The <em>Catalogo dei Forti Terremoti in ltalia </em>is hence the vault that preserves for the present and future generations the wealth of information gathered through old and new research strategies over at least three decades. The data are presented in a uniform and formalized fashion, allowing the reader to navigate upstream from the parameters of a specific earthquake to the original sources that were used to investigate that event. For all these reasons we hope that the users will find it not only useful, but also interesting and stimulating.</p>

			<p>Instrumental catalogues generally supply one record per earthquake. In contrast, the earthquake effects described by historical sources often refer to the combined effect of multiple shocks of a sequence. This is generally unavoidable, since it is always difficult to separate the effects of subsequent shocks, either because they occurred very close in space and time, or simply because of the limited resolution of historical sources.</p>

			<p>In our Catalogue we present the data organized "by earthquake sequence", after aggregating shocks that appear reasonably clustered in both time and space. Occasionally this aggregation has been quite hard, in particular when two or more spatially and chronologically close sequences cannot be separated with confidence. The aggregation of multiple shocks into a single sequence has been crucial during the acquisition, filing and digitization of the retrieved historical information.</p>

			<p>To make it easier to access the historical information and prevent any loss of data that are not directly used to describe the earthquake effects, but may be useful to reconstruct the seismic scenario from different viewpoints, we chose to describe each sequence through a set of synthetic historical-critical comments. Only in a few instances do these comments refer to individual shocks. Conversely, all maps describing the earthquake effects have been prepared for each individual shock, and so are the intensities reported at each locality.</p>

			<p>For this new version of the Catalogue these comments have been organized following seven key-areas, from which we may derive up to 16 sub-areas, depending on the quality of the information available for each earthquake. In the following we provide basic guidelines for exploiting the CFTI5Med most effectively. For further details the reader is encouraged to refer to the paper <a href="http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3661"><em>"Method of investigation, typology and taxonomy of the basic data: navigating between seismic effects and historical contexts"</em></a>, by E. Guidoboni.</p>
			<p>The historical-critical comments prepared for each individual earthquake sequence can always be consulted in the webpage describing the given event by hitting the "Comm." button.</p>

 		   <p><a id="bibliografia"></a>For every investigated sequence CFTI5Med provides the relevant bibliography in an organized form. Each available witness has been filed individually to allow it to be more easily retrieved. The bibliography includes both published and unpublished sources: when listed by author the unpublished sources were ordered by the name of the site where they are kept (archives and libraries). All texts are classified based on the strength assigned to the witness(es) they contain with respect to the earthquake sequence being considered (see list below): notice that this classification refers to individual pieces of information relative to each sequence, not to the whole of the text. Next to each reference the Catalogue provides a link to one or more PDF files containing such texts, when available. For further details see <a href="#testi" onclick="showTEXT('testiPDF')" style="color: #910000;">Original texts in digital form</a>.</p>
			<p>7.1. Classification of the strength of individual testimonies</p>
			<p>All testimonies were ranked according to their characteristics, and ultimately according to their reliability. Each one was assigned a specific code that allows the reader to assess more easily their potential relevance. The codes are the following:</p>
			<p><u>Direct source</u>. The text was written by a contemporary witness, both trustworthy and geographically close to the event described, whose testimony is hence deemed reliable and authoritative.</p>
			<p><u>Source chronologically close to the event</u>. The author is chronologically close to the event (lifetime), but is geographically distant from the site to which the witness refers. It includes all cases where the witness was obtained indirectly from another text or by oral tradition, and it is impossible to trace back the path followed by the information.</p>
			<u>Indirect source</u>. It may include:<br>
			- texts of local historiography which are deemed especially authoritative and close to the event;<br>
			- especially authoritative narrative sources;<br>
			- journalistic texts of the time.</p>
			<p><u>Apocryphal source</u>. It is said of a text that was deemed unreliable. Texts of this category are included in the bibliography only because they were used in previous studies and as such deserve to be re-considered.</p>
			<p><u>Repertoire</u>. A list of earthquakes prepared according to the viewpoints of literary and naturalistic erudition. It also includes texts on the &ldquo;freak events&rdquo; that are typical of the beginning of the modern age, and in general all catalogues compiled before the nineteenth century.</p>
			<p><u>Repertoire-type source</u>. This expression refers to direct sources of information contained in a Repertoire (see above), which in itself can not have the value of a true source since it is usually a collection of late and indirect information.</p>
			<p><u>Catalogue</u>. List of earthquakes compiled from the nineteenth century onwards for scientific or naturalistic purposes. It may be based on selections of sources or works quoted, or may not report any indication of the sources used. It may be descriptive or parametric.</p>
			<p><u>Catalogue-type source</u>. It is a direct testimony contained in an earthquake catalogue, chronologically contemporary to the author or drawn up from direct observations by the author in person or transcribed in full from original texts.</p>
			<p><u>Bulletin</u>. A publication produced through observations or recordings by specialist centers; a table of measurements; a complete or even partial series of measurements taken within different contexts (deeds of academies, articles, etc.). Observations of earthquake effects reported in observatory registries have been considered direct or indirect sources, depending on each specific case.</p>
			<p><u>Generic information</u>. This definition is used to define information taken from secondary historiographic sources (e.g. local social histories), in coveval memoirs or in antiquarian historiography, when the event described is very distant in time or when the information is so generic that is reasonable to assume that the data are not supported by sources known to the author. This code indicates that this information requires further verification, or that it may be interpreted only as a clue for further investigations.</p>
			<p><u>Historiographic study</u>. This code includes studies by contemporary historians (but not necessarily conducted using the criteria of recent critical historiography), specific studies on past earthquakes or studies on relevant aspects of the economic, demographic and social history that were used to improve the understanding of the earthquake effects.</p>
			<p><u>Scientific bibliography</u>. This code is assigned to coeval studies conducted within a specific theoretic interpretative and cognitive framework, starting with the beginning of the nineteenth century, or to recent studies on past earthquakes.</p
			<p><u>Negative source</u>. Source that does not contain information on the earthquake sequence.</p>

 		<div id="localizz" class="HELP-INFOtext">
 			<span style="color: #910000;"><p>One of the most critical steps in the parameterization of historical earthquakes is the assessment of their location. In simple words, the macroseismic epicenter can be calculated as lying in the middle of the spatial distribution of all sites that suffered the largest intensities.</p><p>To parameterize all earthquakes listed in CFTI5Med we used the Boxer computer code v. 3.3 (<a href="grazie%20agli%20strumenti%20di%20ricerca%20su%20base%20geografica%20attualmente%20disponibili%20online,">http://gaspy.df.unibo.it/paolo/boxer/boxer.html</a>; Gasperini, 2004), that had already been used in CFTI4Med for the earthquakes that occurred in the Italian area. The parameters of non-Italian earthquakes, and particularly their equivalent magnitude, may hence differ from those presented in CFTI4Med and in the reference compilations (Guidoboni et al., 1994; Guidoboni and Comastri, 2005), whose authors relied on a previous version of the Boxer code. In addition to that, in CFTI5Med all felt localities across the Mediterranean have been located with higher precision with respect to the previous versions, taking advantage of the more effective geographic tools currently available online. Also for this reason the location of the macroseismic epicenter of Mediterranean earthquakes may be different from that reported in CFTI4Med, Guidoboni et al. (1994) and Guidoboni and Comastri (2005). Notice that in CFTI5Med for all the earthquakes that occurred in the Mediterranean area the macroseismic intensity values assigned to each locality have not been modified with respect to the reference compilations (Guidoboni et al., 1994; Guidoboni and Comastri, 2005).</p>

			<p>The very long chronological interval covered by our Catalogue - about 25 centuries - implies that earthquake locations may belong to different typologies, shown in the legend of the graphic interface and summarized in the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>earthquake location was calculated from a sufficient number of sites for which a microseismic intensity was assigned. It is shown in map with a solid star;</li>
			<li>earthquake location from foreign catalogues. It is shown in map as the calculated location with an additional explicatory note;</li>
			<li>hypotesized epicentral location: when the distribution of intensity observations does not allow a full calculation, the location is hypothesized. In CFTI5Med this happens only in four cases, corresponding to two distinct typologies: for the 1117 earthquake, and for three shocks of the December 1456 sequence. In thr first case the sources suggest the existence of a secondary shock possibly located in Garfagnana (northern Tuscany), whereas in the second case the locations are hypothesized based on tectonic inferences. They are shown in map with an empty star;</li>
			<li>the location is set coincident with the location of a single site for which there exists an intensity assignment. It is shown in map as a solid circle;</li>
			<li>the location is set as lying in the middle of a region identified by the historical sources as the area that suffered the largest effects, without specifying the names of individual localities. It is shown in map as an empty circle;</li>
			<li>unparameterized: this condition refers to an earthquake for which the available information is insufficient or too generic for deriving analytical parameters. It is not shown in map.</li>

 		   <span style="color: #910000;"><p>From the descriptive syntheses of all large earthquakes, both general and analytical, we extracted the information on the number of victims caused by each earthquake. Among all the parameters that can be derived from historical witnesses, the information on the number of victims of an earthquake is usually the most uncertain and variable, its accuracy being largely a function of the historical period considered and of the reliability of witnesses. For the oldest earthquakes these witnesses are often fraught with symbolic meanings and generally report unreliable estimates. In the absence of official estimates from specific surveys, witnesses are often discordant and return very large intervals for the actual number of victims. For all of these reasons we decided to subdivide the number of victims into five macro-categories (&lt;10, 11-100, 101-1000, 1001-10.000, &gt;10.000), attributing to each estimate a reliability class ranging from 1, low, to 3, high. A low reliability was attributed whenever the information was deemed very generic; a high reliability was attributed to cases where the data were derived from official estimates; an average reliability was attributed to all other cases. By rolling over the mouse on the icon describing the numerosity of victims the reader may access the window reporting the exact number - if derived from official estimates - or an interval or a descriptive estimate if this was deemed more realistic (e.g. "many victims"), followed by the legend of the symbols.</p></span>

    		<p> For each of the earthquakes that occurred in the Mediterranean area (non-Italian) in the interval 11th-15th century CFTI5Med makes available a map of the effects on the built environment (macroseismic observations) and of the effects on the natural environment (earthquake-induced environmental effects) reported for &nbsp;each individual locality. These data were not available in CFTI4Med, which reported only epicentral parameters.</span></p>
