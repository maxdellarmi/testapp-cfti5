        <p><strong>Degree I. Imperceptibly.</strong> Just display of earthquake instruments.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree II. Very light. </strong>Felt only by a few isolated, located in perfect peace, nervous or very sensitive people and indeed almost only be carried out in the upper floors of the houses.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree IIl. Light.</strong> Even in densely populated area, the quake is only a small part of the population located inside the house felt as vibration, as in the fast passing driving a car. Only later recognized as austaush earthquake fairy tale by the mutual thoughts.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree IV. Moderate.</strong> Not many of the people who are outside of the buildings feel the earthquake. Inside the houses it is certainly identified by numerous, but not all, people, in consequence of the trembling or slight oscillatory movement of the furniture and of the glassware and china which, put close to each other, knock against each other, like at the passing of a heavy truck on irregular paving. Windows tinkle, doors, beams and boards bang, the ceilings creak. In open recipients, liquids are lightly moved. One has the impression that, inside of the house, a heavy object (sack, furniture) is being overturned or that one is swaying together with the entire chair or bed etc., like a ship on a rough sea. This movement causes little fear, except in case of persons who became nervous or fearful because of previous earthquakes. The sleeping rarely wake up.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree V. Quite strong.</strong> Even during the day, the earthquake is felt by a large number of people on the street or outdoors. In flats the earthquake is noticed because of the shaking of the entire building. Plants as well as the thin branches of bushes and trees move visibly, as if moved by a moderate wind. Free hanging objects start to oscillate, like for example curtains, suspended traffic lights, hanging lamps, and not too heavy chandeliers; bells start to sound, pendulum-clocks stop or oscillate with a wider movement, depending on whether the direction of the shock is perpendicular or parallel to the direction of the oscillation of the pendulum; thus, stopped pendulum-clocks may start functioning again; mainsprings ring; electric lights flicker or are interrupted according to the contact of the wires; pictures bang against the walls or move; small quantities of liquid spill from open, full recipients; knick-knacks etc. and also objects leaning against the walls may knock over; light furniture may even slightly move from their place; furniture rattle; doors and shutters open or close; the glass in the windows breaks. General awaking of the sleeping. In some isolated cases the inhabitants run outside.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree VI. Strong</strong>. The earthquake is felt by all with fear; therefore many run outside, some think they will fall. Liquids move quite strongly; pictures, books, and similar, fall from walls and shelves; dishes are broken; rather stable furnishings and even isolated pieces of furniture are moved or fall; smaller bells in chapels and churches, clocks of bell-towers sound. Isolated, solidly built houses suffer small damage; cracks in the plaster, the plastering falls from the ceilings and walls. Heavier, but still harmless damage on badly constructed buildings. Some isolated tile or stone of the chimney-pot may fall.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree VII. Very strong</strong>. Remarkable damage is caused to a higher number of furnishings of the flats, even to the very heavy ones, which are thrown over or smashed. The bigger bells toll. Watercourses, ponds and lakes throw waves and become turbid because of the moving slime. There are isolated slidings of parts of the sand and gravel banks. Water level changes in wells. Moderate damage to many solidly built buildings: small fissures in the walls, crumbling of large areas of plaster, and stucco decoration, of bricks; in general roof tiles fall. Many chimneys are damaged by cracks, falling of the cover plate and falling out of stones. Damaged chimney pots fall on the roof damaging it. Badly fixed decorations fall down from towers and tall buindings. In half-timbered buildings the damage to the plastering and the frameworks is already worse. Isolated collapse of badly built or badly preserved houses.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree VIII. Destructive</strong>. Entire tree trunks wave vividly or are even break off. Also the heavier furniture is partially moved far from the place, partially overturned. Statues, milestones and the like, connected with the ground, rotate on their pedestal or fall, also in churches, cemeteries and public parks etc. Solid stone boundary walls are opened and knocked down. About &frac14; of the houses reports heavy destructions; isolated houses collapse, many become uninhabitable. In half-timbered buildings, a big part of the padding falls. Wooden houses crumple or are knocked over. Church towers and factory chimneys are affected, but their collapse can cause damage to nearby buildings more than the earthquake effect alone does. Fissures are formed in steep slopes and marshy grounds; sand and slime come out of wet grounds.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree IX. Devastating</strong>. About &frac12; of the stone houses is heavily destroyed, a certain number of them collapses, the largest part becomes uninhabitable. Half-timbered buildings are pulled up from their own foundations and squashed, this way sometimes the beams of some frames are sheared, thus considerably contributing to their ruin.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree X. Annihilating</strong>. Heavy destruction of about &frac34; of the buildings, most of them collapses. Even solid wooden buildings and bridges suffer heavy damage, some are also destroyed. Embankments and dams etc. are more or less considerably damaged, rails are lightly bent and pipes (gas, water and waste) are cut off, broken or crushed. Fissures are formed in the paved and asphalted layer of the streets and due to the pressure large waving folds jut out. In the soft, and especially wet ground, fissures, even more than several decimetres wide, are formed; in particular parallel to the watercourses, up to 1 m cracks are formed. Not only does soft ground slide from the slopes under the form of a landslide, but also entire boulders role towards the valley under the form of falling rocks. Big rocks break off the river banks and the steep coasts; on the low coasts sand and mud masses are moved; thus the relief of the ground sometimes undergoes not secondary changes. Wells frequently vary in water level. From rivers, canals and lakes etc., the water is thrown against the banks or shores.</p>

        <p><strong>Degree XI. Catastrophe</strong>. Collapse of all stone buildings. Solid wooden structures and resilient wickerwork huts are only able to withstand isolated conditions. Even the bigger and safer bridges collapse due to the breaking of the stone pillars or to the yielding of the iron ones. Embankments and dams are completely separated from each other, often for a long way; rails are strongly bent and compressed. Tubes in the ground are completely separated from each other and become unusable. The ground undergoes various, considerable changes, which are determined by the nature of the soil: big cracks and fissures open up; and most of all in wet and marshy grounds, the dislocations are significant in the vertical and vertical direction. In addition, there is an overflow of water that brings with it sand and slime in its different forms. The landslides and rockfalls are numerous</p>

        <p><strong>Degree XII. Great catastrophe</strong>. No man-made work resists. The transformation of the ground takes on enormous dimensions. Accordingly water flows , under and above the ground, undergo the most various changes: waterfalls are formed, lakes stagnate, rivers divert, etc.</p>
