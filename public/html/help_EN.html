			<p>The general structure of the web-interface follows the scheme shown below. The three frames on the left are the three types of access to the contents of the CFTI catalogue (page of access to the list of earthquakes, localities or effects on the natural environment), while the two frames on the right are the pages that describe an individual earthquake or locality. The red arrows indicate the connections between the different page types. </p>
	        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../images/HELP/struct_gen_EN.png" alt="struttura gen_EN" width="80%" /></p>
	        <p>All web-pages have a similar structure (see figure below), consisting of an informative section on the left (a selection panel and/or tables and/or additional information) and a map on the right, showing markers of earthquakes / localities / effects on the natural environment / macroseismic observations. all are listed in the table located in the left frame. </p>
	        <p>The left frame also hosts two icons that allow the selected data to be exported in text or kml format.</p>
	        <p>Additional tools on the map include:</p>
	        <ul>
	        <li>Geographic search box (based on Google Maps)</li>

			<li>Two buttons to add map overlays:
				<ul>
				<li>the top button opens a list of map overlays that can be displayed on the basemap (note that the availability of some layers is scale-dependent):</li>

				<li>the other button opens a window that allows the user to add to the map the instrumental earthquake locations supplied by the surveillance service of INGV (between 1985 and today), based on queries made through a selection panel. The epicenters are shown on the map after hitting the 'OK' button.

Each bibliographic source may be available either as a transcribed text (PDF_T), or as a scanned copy of the original source (PDF_R), or both. The pdf files can be accessed by clicking on the "PDF_T" and/or "PDF_R" links (see figure below).

			<li>clicking on the CFTI5Med banner on top of all pages brings you back to the home page (Access by earthquake page);</li>

	        <li>all tables are sortable by clicking on any column header;</li>
	        <li>hit the 'OK' button to run a query set through the selection panels for all three modes of access to the catalogue information);</li>
	        <li>the background colors of infowindow titles indicate the type of information given. All information on earthquakes is shown with a light blue title, while information on localities is shown with a light red title. The same colors are used as a background for the info|disclaimer|help menu on the top-left corner of the pages showing individual localities and individual earthquakes and for the pages of access by earthquake and locality;</li>
			<li>map locations are given with geographical coordinates (WGS84) in degrees rounded to three decimal places;</li>
			<li>clicking on epicentral markers that overlap or are very close turns them blue: the symbols are displayed in a circle, with black bars connecting them to their original position. Their size, that is proportional to epicentral intensity following the size scheme shown in the legend, remains unchanged. Similarly to any other markers on the map, clicking on a blue marker opens an infowindow, (see figure below).</li>

		   <p>Three possible cases of tables structure may occur, shown in the figure below:
			   <ol type="a">
				   <li>a table listing individual earthquakes associated with effects on the built environment and, when reported, effects on the natural environment. Each line of the table corresponds to one epicenter on the map;</li>
				   <li>a table listing earthquake sequences associated with effects on the natural environment at this site, that cannot be associated with a single shock of the sequence. The epicenters of these earthquakes are not shown in the map;</li>
				   <li> two tables, the top one corresponding to that described in a) and the other corresponding to that described in b). The map shows only the epicenters listed in the top table only.</li>

	        <p>On page startup the map shows the epicenters of the earthquakes that caused effects at the locality. The user can browse the map distribution of all effects caused by each event listed in the table by clicking the buttons in the column "Map". The current locality is displayed with a drop-shaped icon. All icons are color-coded by MCS intensity, following the scheme shown in the legend located in the bottom-left corner of the map. The icons with green edge indicate effects on the natural environment. Similarly to the page available for any individual earthquake, a link in the map legend takes the user to a description of the MCS scale (Mercalli-Càncani-Sieberg 1932).</p>

			<p> If the locality has changed its name over time, it is shown in the title with its current name and with the historical name(s) in parentheses. A note indicates the date of the name change(s). The note may contain also information on site changes of the locality. In the maps showing earthquake effects, instead, the locality appears with the name it had at the time of the earthquake. One of the most complex cases, that of Vibo Valentia (for which CFTI5Med reports three different denominations), is shown in the figure below.<br>
			The user can also access more information on the locality through a direct link to the corresponding Wikipedia webpage, located next to the locality name in the title of the page (top-left frame). </p>
