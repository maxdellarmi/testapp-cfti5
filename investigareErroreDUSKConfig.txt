Running the default Selenium Docker images on an M1 machine won't work. Use the Selenium ARM-specific images instead. 
 
 Laravel Dusk environment configuration
First, make sure your DuskTestCase (the base test class) is up-to-date with the stub from the Dusk repository.

In your Dusk environment configuration (.env.dusk.local), set APP_URL='http://nginx' and DUSK_DRIVER_URL='http://selenium:4444/wd/hub.

Laravel Dusk: Facebook\WebDriver\Exception\UnknownErrorException: unknown error: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

I faced the same issue and for me what worked was setting the APP_URL parameter in the .env file as:

APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
As that was the same port on which my php artisan serve would also serve the website i.e.

Laravel development server started: http://127.0.0.1:8000
I have no idea and still can't believe why this worked. – 
I suppose dusk needs to use the website being served to run the browser tests. It doesn't run its own servers but uses the same as your app. – 
My issue was a little different, but this was a helpful clue! 
I am running my tests inside a Docker-driven environment and I needed to have APP_URL=http://nginx:8080 
(where nginx is the name of the container in which chromedriver is running) in .env.testing, whereas 
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080 is needed in .env. Tricky little issue; thanks! – 


'm putting this out there for others that might face the same thing as me.

It turns out Laravel Dusk expects us to run 
********* php artisan serve *************
before running php artisan dusk! The ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED error refers to not being able to connect to the http://localhost:8000 
URL of the application itself, because it's not running.

This does make sense, but I simply didn't know and the documentation was not clear on that (I had to deduce it). 
The ChromeDriver, however, is started automatically by Dusk at execution time.
